# Termux-truecaller

I hate truecaller app and its notifications.

Install it via install.sh script 
It is only for my personal usecase. 

#### Usecase
It will notify if any unknown number caught. In notification, there will be name, number and emails with calling button
 where one can call directly from notification.

#### Requirements:

* Termux-api apps 
* Nodejs (truecaller core)
Register with your number.
`truecaller register [Ten Digit no.]`  #Indian number applicable


#### Limitations

* Applicable for only indian users
* Android >= 9
